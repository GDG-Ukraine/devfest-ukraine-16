## 1. Shmuela, please, tell a bit about the work you do. How did you first get involved into this work?
I’m a front-end developer, consultant and trainer, focusing on Angular. I’ve encountered programming a few times throughout my life, but only during my Masters studies it really got to me. I started working as a student with C++, Java and Python. But I realized that everything starts evolving around the Web. I started going to meetups,and that’s where I found out about AngularJS. I loved it, so I took a course and started working in a consulting agency. After gaining some experience and starting to work with Angular (the new version), I decided to become self-employed so I can be free to go to conferences around the world, teach, learn, and work wherever I want.

## 2. What is your favorite thing about your job?
Do I have to choose one? :) As a front-end developer I like the quick results - coding something and seeing it work immediately in front of my eyes. I love working with people, sharing knowledge and solving problems together. 

## 3. Do you have any advice for someone interested in pursuing the same career?
When you learn and work with people you get to discover things that are sometimes hard to find in tutorials and online courses. If possible, take a frontal course, go to meetups, and get a job - even as a junior. Also, work on a demo project - just a little idea of your own that you can implement, so you can learn from real experience and then show it in interviews.

## 4. Tell us more about ngGirls movement. What inspired you to start it?
The world of opportunities in programming was discovered to me in a relatively late stage. Whenever I didn’t get something (like pointers) I thought it’s just easier for guys to grasp. But I was lucky to be exposed to programming again and again, and finally realize that it’s not as hard as I thought and I actually enjoy it. I understand today that I had a falsified view of the world, and that anyone can experience unconscious bias of that kind. I started taking part in programs that encourage women to get into the programming world, such as Django Girls, Rails Girls and Google Code F. About a year ago, I thought about the great opportunity we have with Angular: with Typescript it becomes easy to understand the code, and the declarative state of mind (bindings and directives used in the HTML templates) are intuitive. And most important, the Angular community is warm and dedicated. I decided to follow the Django Girls model and organize free workshops for women all around the world - using Angular. I’ve been lucky to have successful events with awesome mentors, some of whom have joined the effort and became part of the ngGirls team.

## 5. Can you give us a sneak peek into your  GDG DevFest Ukraine talk? Why did you choose this subject?
Seems like the concept of Progressive Web Applications has been around for several years, but lately more and more developers and companies understand its importance. Even Apple has lately announced to start supporting PWAs. It’s a combination of the strengths of both the web and the native mobile worlds. Angular as a platform aspires to give tools to easily “progressify” your applications. These tools are still in development, but they already give impressive results.


## 6. How do you prefer to spend your free time?
I love traveling and hiking. I’m also into singing (I’ve always wanted to be a singer…), but you really need more free time to make something real out of it. Hmmm… I’ll be hanging around Lviv for a few days, jam session anyone? :-D


## 7. What do you think will be the next big trend in the industry in the next few years?
Web applications will rule the industry. The computers and mobile phones have become so strong that they can carry out heavy processes, and the users prefer to avoid installations. There are already many programs that have been reconstructed and adjusted to web. In this field, I believe we’ll see more tools to help us create web applications, while focusing on features instead of boilerplates, such as Angular, Firebase, Wix and so on. Another area that is quickly developing is Machine Learning - the strong computation abilities can help us analyze any type of media and give results in high accuracy. There are already fascinating, world-changing implementations in the health industry, for instance.

## 8. DevFest Ukraine motto is “Make the most of development. Make the most of you”. What do you do to make the most of development? :)

When I make most of development I enjoy developing. This comes in various forms: I try to understand what I’m writing and why it works the way it does - instead of just copy-pasting code snippets. I talk to other developers and discuss various methods for design and implementation. I go to meetups and conferences and discover new tools and ideas. And, as much as I can, I use my skills to work on projects that I relate to and believe in.
