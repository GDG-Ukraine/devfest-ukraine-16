We are happy to announce [GDG DevFest Ukraine](https://www.facebook.com/devfest.ukraine/?fref=mentions) grows even bigger this year â€” as a part of our conference, we will also run the very first 

ngGirls workshop in Lviv!

Are you a woman, interested in learning how to build web applications with the latest technologies? We have good news for you: we are holding a one-day workshop for beginners! 

During the workshop, you will build and deploy your first Angular Web Application! 

Angular is an open-source platform for building web applications, developed by Google and the community. It gives various tools to easily create a dynamic, interactive app that can run on desktop browsers, 

mobile and even robots!ðŸš€

The workshop will be run by Shmuela Jacobs â€” a front-end developer, consultant, speaker, and community activist. She is the founder of 

ngGirls and Angular Nights meetup group. During her academic studies, Shmuela had combined her passions of coding and teaching as a software developer, teaching assistant, science museum guide, and researcher. Today she continues to enjoy these activities developing with Angular and sharing her knowledge and experience in meetups and conferences.

The event is kindly supported by [Angular Lviv Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AngularLviv) and [TechMagic](http://www.techmagic.co/).

Participation is FREE, but seats are limited, so hurry up to book yours! [https://goo.gl/forms/ZdQPvsg4sRZ7KJEZ2](https://goo.gl/forms/ZdQPvsg4sRZ7KJEZ2)
