[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) connects the world’s best organizations with the world’s top talent. We are a network of senior software engineers, designers, and finance talent spanning more than 100 countries without a single office. 

One of the key aspects that sets Toptal apart is its community. The community hosts and sponsors more than 400 events each year in addition to a variety of educational and philanthropic initiatives including the Toptal Speakers Network, STEM Scholarships for Women, and Toptal Open Source Grants.


## Open Source Is Changing the World

If two minds are better than one, how about two thousand? When people collaborate, they can create amazing things! This is the philosophy behind open source.

Our societies continue to improve when we work together toward the same goal. Removing borders between countries promotes progress and making software is no different- removing borders between developers ensures that magical things happen. The open source initiative has been growing since the day it started. Even the great opponents of open source embrace the necessity of the initiative and are taking the lead.


## Toptal Open Source Grants

Toptal is a global leader in delivering high-quality developers, designers, and financial experts to clients all over the world. Have you heard about [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [Videogular](http://www.videogular.com/)? There is a high possibility that you have used an open source library or a tool in your daily work that was contributed to by one of our developers.

This is not by accident! Toptal is dedicated to supporting open source projects and our Community is heavily involved in Toptal Open Source Grants. People contribute to open source as passion projects and we are well aware that this work takes time. There has to be a fine balance between commercial work and “a hobby”. This is why we created a fund to offset Toptalers’ cost of living while they contribute to open source projects. Open source grant winners are free to work on their personal projects or contribute to other existing projects.

Toptal will be contributing up to $100,000 and applications for Toptal Open Source Grants are open throughout the year. We invite you to join Toptal and take advantage of this and many other great Toptal Community initiatives.
